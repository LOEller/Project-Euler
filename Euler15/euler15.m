% what if the solution to this problem is just to view the number of steps
% as a function of the size of the lattice, so just write a program that
% uses the binary counter trick and a 'player' to walk through the lattice
% according to the paths and count which paths actually lead to the end,
% and just record how many paths there are for each of the sizes of the
% lattices, then see if it is a function that we can use just to
% interpolate the number of paths for 20x20. If worse comes to worse, then
% you can just use that program to brute force the 20x20 and it might takes
% weeks but you'd have an answer!
